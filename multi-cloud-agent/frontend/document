Task result includes goal, status, creation time, update time, and execution history
7. Multi-Cloud Management
Features
Unified interface for AWS, Azure, and GCP operations
VM management (list, create, delete)
Storage management (buckets, blobs)
Network resource management
Cloud Providers
AWS: Uses boto3 for AWS API integration
Azure: Uses azure-identity and azure-mgmt packages
GCP: Uses google-cloud packages
Implementation Notes
Provider-specific implementations are abstracted behind common interfaces
Error handling for cloud provider API failures
8. Intent Extraction
Features
Extract structured intents from natural language prompts
Convert user requests into actionable steps
Support for multi-cloud operations
Integration
Used internally by the agent system
Powered by Gemini AI model

Implementation Notes
Memory is persisted in a JSON file and/or database
Used to improve agent performance over time

Authentication Flow
1.
Implement login/signup forms in the frontend
2.
Store JWT token securely (e.g., in HttpOnly cookies or secure storage)
3.
Include token in Authorization header for API requests
4.
Implement token refresh mechanism
Real-time Communication
1.
Establish WebSocket connections for chat and agent updates
2.
Implement message handlers for different message types
3.
Provide UI feedback for connection status
Error Handling
1.
Implement consistent error handling for API responses
2.
Display appropriate user feedback for different error types
3.
Provide retry mechanisms for transient failures
Security Considerations
1.
Never store unencrypted credentials in frontend state
2.
Implement proper input validation
3.
Use HTTPS for all API communications
4.
Implement proper CORS configuration
Performance Optimization
1.
Implement pagination for large result sets
2.
Use WebSockets for real-time updates instead of polling
3.
Implement caching where appropriate
