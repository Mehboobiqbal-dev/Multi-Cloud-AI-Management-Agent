        "The population of theregion of Palestine, which approximately corresponds to modernIsraeland thePalestine, has varied in both size and ethnic composition throughout thehistory of Palestine.",
        "Studies of Palestine's demographic changes over the millennia have shown that a Jewish majority in the first century AD had changed to a Christian majority by the 3rd century AD,[4]and later to a Muslim majority, which is thought to have existed inMandatory Palestine(1920-1948) since at least the 12th century AD, during which the total shift to Arabic language was completed.[5]",
        "During the seventh century BC, no fewer than eight nations were settled in Palestine. These included theArameansof the kingdom ofGeshur; theSamaritanswho replaced the Israelite kingdom inSamaria; thePhoeniciansin the northern cities and parts ofGalilee; thePhilistinesin thePhilistine pentapolis; the three kingdoms of theTransjordan–Ammon,MoabandEdom; and the Judaeans ofKingdom of Judah.[6]",
        "According to Finkelstein and Broshi, the population of Palestine at the end of the eighth century BC was around 400,000. In the area of Judah in the central hills,BenjaminandJerusalem, the population was approximately 110,000. By the early sixth century, Ofer's survey results suggest that around 100,000 lived in the kingdom of Judah, with the population in the central hills, Benjamin and Jerusalem about 69,000.[7]",
        "A study by Yigal Shiloh ofThe Hebrew Universitysuggests that the population of Palestine in theIron Agecould have never exceeded one million. He writes: \"... the population of the country in the Roman-Byzantine period greatly exceeded that in the Iron Age...\" Shiloh accepted Israeli archaeologist Magen Broshi's estimates of Palestine's population at 1,000,000–1,250,000 and noted that Iron Age Israel's population must have been less considering population growth. \"...If we accept Broshi's population estimates, which appear to be confirmed by the results of recent research, it follows that the estimates for the population during the Iron Age must be set at a lower figure.\"[8]One study of population growth from 1000 BC to 750 BC estimated the population of Palestine (JudahandIsrael) had an average natural growth of 0.4 per cent per annum.[9]",
        "After theBabylonian conquestofJudahand exile, the population and settlement density ofJerusalem, theShephelahand theNaqab desertdropped significantly.[10]The Persian province ofYehud Medinatawas sparsely-populated and predominantly rural, with around half of the settlements of late Iron ageJudahand a population of around 30,000 in the 5th to 4th centuries BC.[11][12]On the other hand, settlement continuity is discerned in the northern parts of theJudean mountainsand theBenjamin area. Cities such asTell en-Nasbeh,GibeonandBethelmanaged to escape destruction and remained continuously inhabited until the earlyAchaemenid rule.[10]",
        "As early as the 7th century BC,Edomiteshad lived in theNaqab desertand southern Judah, and by the time Judah fell in 586 BC there was already a substantial Edomite population in southern Judah. When the kingdom of Edom itself succumbed, those people continued its traditions in the south, which the Arabic-speakingQedaritescontrolled.[13][14][10][15]This area, which became known as Idumaea, was inhabited by a diverse population of Edomites, Judahites, Phoenicians, Qedarites and other Arabs.[16]Based on analysis of epigraphic material andostracafrom the region, around 32% of recorded names wereArabic, 27% wereEdomite, 25% wereNorthwest Semitic, 10% were Judahite (Hebrew) and 5% werePhoenician.[17]A few names were also classifiedEgyptianandOld Iranian.[14]",
        "Theexilic returneesresettled during the time ofCyrus the Great, perhaps with a heightened sense of their ethnic identity.[10]Along the coast of western Palestine, thePhoeniciansexpanded their presence, whileMoabitesandAmmonitestook refuge in the Cisjordan after the destruction of their kingdoms in 582 BC.[10]",
        "Following theMacedonianconquest of theAchaemenid Empireand the subsequentWars of the Diadochi, Palestine came underHellenisticrule and was contested by theSeleucidsandPtolemaics.[18]",
        "Between 167 and 160 BC, the Jewish rebel faction of theMaccabeesrevolted against Seleucid rule, ultimately leading to the independence of theHasmonean dynasty. UnderJohn Hyrcanus, the Hasmoneans expanded their territories beyond the traditional confines of Judea and incorporated non-Jewish areas in the process.[19][20][21][22]1 Maccabeesrelates that the non-Jewish inhabitants ofGezerandJoppawere expelled bySimon Thassi, who settled Jews in their place.[23]Coinciding with the account ofJosephus, archaeological evidence attests to significant destruction in the urban and rural settlements in Idumaea,Samariaand the coastal cities from the Hasmonean conquests, followed by the resettlement of Jews in the newly conquered territories.[24]Nevertheless, there's evidence that some of the non-Jewish inhabitants stayed in all of the newly conquered areas.[19]",
        "Many sites inIdumaeaexperienced destruction, includingMaresha, Khirbet el-Rasm,Tel Arad,Khirbet 'Uzaand possiblyLachish. The lower city of Maresha and TelBeershebawere soon abandoned, and evidence for an increased Idumaean presence inEgyptsuggests some immigrated there. Idumaeans were eventually forcibly proselytized and co-opted into the Jewish nation by John Hyrcanus.[19]Further north, theGalileereceived significant Jewish migration from Judea after its conquest, contributing to a 50% increase in settlements, while the pagan population was greatly reduced. By the end ofAlexander Jannaeus' reign, the Galilee was also predominantly Jewish.[25]However, unlike John Hyrcanus, Alexander Jannaeus did not compel the non-Jews to assimilate to the Jewish ethnos and permitted minorityethnēto exist within Hasmonean borders, with the exception of Phoenician coastal cities in the north whom Josephus claims he enslaved.",
        "The Roman conquest of Judea led byPompeytook place in 63 BC. The Roman occupation encompassed the end of Jewish independence in Judea, the last years of the Hasmonean kingdom, the Herodian age and the rise ofChristianity, theFirst Jewish–Roman War, and thefall of Jerusalemand the destruction of theSecond Temple.[26]The total population ofPharisees, the forerunners of modernRabbinic Judaism, was around 6,000 (\"exakischilioi\"), according toJosephus.[27]Local population displacements occurred with the expulsion of the Jews from Jerusalem[28]– \"In the earlier revolt in the previous century, 66–73 CE, Rome destroyed the Temple and forbade Jews to live in the remaining parts ofJerusalem; for this reason, the Rabbis gathered instead on the Mediterranean coast inYavnehnearJaffa\". Dispersal to other parts of theRoman Empireoccurred, but some earlier settlements were also established as early as 4 BC.[29]",
        "Modern estimates vary: Applebaum argues that in theHerodian kingdom, there were 1.5 million Jews, a figure Ben David says covers the numbers inJudeaalone.Salo Wittmayer Baronestimated the population at 2.3 million at the time ofRoman emperorClaudius(reigned 41–54). According to Israeli archeologist Magen Broshi, west of theJordan Riverthe population certainly did not exceed 1 million:[30]",
        "\"... the population of Palestine in antiquity did not exceed a million persons. It can also be shown, moreover, that this was more or less the size of the population in the peak period – the lateByzantineperiod, around AD 600\"[31]",
        "Broshi made calculations based on the grain-producing capacity of Palestine and on its role in the indigenous diet, assuming an average annual per-capita consumption of 200 kg. (with a maximum of 250 kg.), which would work out to the limit of a sustainable population of 1,000,000 people, a figure which, Broshi states, remained roughly constant down to the end of theByzantine period(600 CE).[32]The proportion of Jews to gentiles is also unknown.[30]",
        "TheBar Kokhba revoltin the 2nd century saw a major shift in the population of Palestine. The sheer scale and scope of the overall destruction, according to a late epitome ofDio Cassius'sRoman History, where he states that Roman war operations in the country had left some 580,000 Jews dead, with many more dying of hunger and disease, while 50 of their most important outposts and 985 of their most famous villages were razed to the ground. \"Thus,\" writes Dio Cassius, \"nearly the whole ofJudaeawas made desolate.\"[33][34]Goodblatt contends that while Bar Kokhba rendered much of theJudaean Mountainsand theHebron Hillsdesolate, Jewish communities continued to thrive in other parts of Judea and Palestine as a whole.",
        "\"The destruction of the Jewish metropolis ofJerusalemand its environs and the ventual refoundation of the city as the Roman colony ofAelia Capitolinahad lasting repercussions. However, in other parts of Palestine the Jewish population remained strong. Literary and archaeological evidence indicates that in the Late Roman-early Byzantine era Jewish commuinities thrived along the eastern, southern and western edges ofJudah, in theGalilee,Golanand theBeit Sheanregion. And a strong Jewish presence continued throughout this period in manypoleis, includingCaesarea Maritimaand Scythopolis.\"[35]",
        "When exactly Jews became a minority is disputed.[30][35]Eschel argues that a combination of three events: therise of Christianity, the Jewish-Roman wars andJewish Diasporamade Jews in the minority.[36]David Goodblatt contends that Jews suffered a setback following theBar Kokhba revolt(132–136), noting that Jews were still in the majority until the 3rd century and even beyond, when Christianity became the empire's official religion, and continued to thrive in different parts of Palestine.[35]According to Doron Bar, archaeological evidence ofsynagogueremains demonstrate a central Jewish presence throughout Palestine during the entire Byzantine period.[37]",
        "The 'ascension' ofConstantine the Greatin 312 and Christianity becoming theofficial state religion of Romein 391, consequently brought to an end Jewish dominance in Palestine.[38]Already by the mid-3rd century the Jewish majority had been reported to have been lost, while others conclude that a Jewish majority lasted much longer – \"What does seem clear is a different kind of change – immigration of Christians and the conversion of pagans, Samaritans, and Jews eventually produced a Christian majority\".[4]After theBar Kokhba revoltof 132–136 CE the make-up of the population of Palestine remains in doubt due to the sparsity of data in the historical record. Figures vary considerably as to the demographics of Palestine in the Christian era.[39]",
        "No reliable data exist on the population of Palestine in the pre-Muslim period, either in absolute terms or in terms of shares of total population. Although many Jews were killed, expelled or sold off into slavery after the AD 66–70 and the 123–125 rebellions, the degree to which these transfers affected the Jewish dominance in Palestine is rarely addressed. What is certain is that Palestine did not lose its Jewish component. Goldblatt[4]concludes that the Jews may have remained a majority into the 3rd century AD and even beyond. He notes that 'Jewish followers of Jesus' (Jewish Christians) would not have taken part in the rebellions. Moreover, non-Christian conversions from Judaism after the Bar Kochba revolt were not given much attention.",
        "\"Indeed, many must have reacted to the catastrophe with despair and total abandonment of Judaism. Apostates from Judaism (aside from converts to Christianity) received little notice in antiquity from either Jewish or non-Jewish writers, but ambitious individuals are known to have turned pagan before the war, and it stands to reason that many more did so after its disastrous conclusion. It is impossible to determine the number who joined the budding Christian movement and the number who disappeared into the polytheist majority.\"[40]",
        "The administrative reorganization of the region in 284–305 AD by theEastern Romansproduced three Palestinian provinces of\"Greater Palestine\"which lasted from the 4th to the early 7th centuries:Palaestina Prima, which included the historic regions ofPhilistia,JudeaandSamariawith the capital inCaesarea Maritima;Palaestina Secunda, which included theGalilee, theGolan Heights, as well as parts ofPerea(western Transjordan) and theDecapolis, with its capital beingScythopolis; andPalaestina Salutariswhich includedIdumaea, theNaqab desert,Arabia Petraea, parts ofSinai, and Transjordan south of theDead Sea, with its capital inPetra.[41][5]",
        "Under the Byzantines, the religious landscape of Palestine underwent a significant transformation, propelled by the widescaleChristianizationof the local Jewish, pagan and Samaritan communities, as well as immigration of Christian pilgrims and monks into the Holy land.[42][43][44][45]After the failure ofBar Kokhba revoltin 135, Jews were barred from living in a large part of former Judaea.[46]During this period, Jews were concentrated in theGalilee, theGolanand marginal areas of theJudaean hills,[47]betweenEleutheropolisandHebronin the Daromas,[46]with significant Jewish settlement in the strip betweenEin GediandAscalon.[43]Jews also lived in the southernJordan ValleynearJericho, where they were employed indateandBalsamplantations; around Narbata, in Samaria and in theJezreel Valley. However, the main centres of Jewish life and culture during this period were the cosmopolitan cities of the coastal plains, particularlyLydda,Jamnia,AzotusandCaesarea Maritima.[46]Samaritans, originally concentrated in communities aroundMount Gerizim, had spread beyond Samaria proper in the second century and established communities in the coastal plains, Judea and the Galilee, with some Samaritan villages located as far as Golan.[43]However, theSamaritan revoltsagainst the Byzantines in 484–573 and their forced conversion to Christianity underMaurice(582–602) andHeraclius(610–641) significantly diminished their numbers.[45][44][48][49][50][51]",
        "Pagan tradition flourished in the period beforeConstantine,[46]and pagans were a majority in the coastal plains,[47]Judea,Samaria, theNaqaband much of the urban centers.[43][52]Although proscribed in theBible, pagan cults had thrived in Palestine throughout theFirstandSecond Templeperiod, and many Jews did not escape it.[53][46][54][55][56]According to E. Friedheim, many Jews in Palestine also embraced paganism and pagan cults again following the destruction of theSecond Templein 70 AD.[57]Talmudic tradition forbid customs relating to 'theAmoriteways', showing a persistence of ancient Canaanite customs among the non-Jewish population and their inconsistent penetration into Jewish circles.[55]",
        "Christian presence at the start of this period was mainly evidenced in Hellenistic cities and some of the villages in southern Judea.[43]However, Christianity's early influence in either the Jewish, Samaritan or pagan rural areas was minor and came at a much later stage around the sixth century, when many of the community churches inJudea, westernGalilee, the Naqab and other places were built.[58][59][37][60]By the fifth century, many pagan temples in Palestine including those in Jerusalem,Bethlehem,Mamre,Tel QadeshandTel Dan, had been demolished, and churches were erected in their place.[42][58][61][59]In the rural sector, vast areas of Palestine, such asGalileeandSamaria, had Jewish and Samaritan majorities, and Christianity spread in these areas far more gradually and at a slower pace, achieving real momentum only during the second half of the Byzantine period.[37][62][35]Christianity had also spread in theNabataeancities, towns and villages in southern Palestine, where a mixed Christian and pagan population lived, with elaborate churches built inAbdah,MampsisandSubeita.[63]",
        "Palestine reached its peak population of around 1 to 1.5 million during this period. However, estimates of the relative proportions of Jews, Samaritans and pagans vary widely and are speculative. By counting settlements,Avi-Yonahestimated that Jews comprised half the population of the Galilee at the end of the 3rd century, and a quarter in the other parts of the country, but had declined to 10–15% of the total by 614.[4]On the other hand, by counting churches andsynagogues, Tsafrir estimated the Jewish proportion to be 25% in the Byzantine period.[4]Stemberger, however, considers that Jews were the largest population group at the beginning of the 4th century, closely followed by the pagans.[64]According to Schiffman, DellaPergola and Bar, Christians only became the majority of the country's population at the beginning of the fifth century,[65][66][58]",
        "Prior to theMuslim conquest of Palestine(635–640),Palaestina Primahad a population of 700 thousand, of which around 100 thousand were Jews and 30 to 80 thousand were Samaritans,[67]with the remainder beingChalcedonianandMiaphysiteChristians.[5][68][69]Arabs came to constitute a ruling minority in Palestine who despised farming and kept their nomadic lifestyle, with the tribes ofLakhm,Judham,Kinana,Khath'am,Khuza'a, andAzd Saratforming the army ofJund Filastin(military district of Palestine).[70]",
        "The pace of conversion to Islam among the various Christian, Jewish, and Samaritan communities in Palestine varied during the early period (638–1098),[71]and opinions vary regarding the extent of Islamization during the early Islamic period.[72]Some argue Palestine was already majority Muslim by the time of arrival of theFirst Crusade,[71]while others contend that Christians were still in the majority and the process of mass adoption of Islam took place only from the 13th century onwards, during theMamluk period.[73]",
        "According to archaeologist Gideon Avni, archaeological surveys show that most Christian settlements and sites preserved their identity up to the crusader period, supplemented by the numerosity of churches andmonasteriesall over Palestine.[73]The early Muslim population, on the other hand, was confined to the Umayyad palaces in theJordan Valleyand around theSea of Galilee, theribatfortresses along the coast and the farms of theNaqab desert. Thus, conversion to Islam only gained real momentum in Palestine afterSaladin'sconquest of Jerusalemin 1187 and the expulsion ofFranks.[73]Arabic gradually replacedPalestinian Aramaicand largely by the 9th century, while Islamization was only finalized in the Mamluk period.[74]",
        "Urban centers continued to flourish after the Islamic conquest, but changes took place in the 9th and 10th centuries.[63][73]According to Ellenblum, climate disasters andearthquakesin the late 10th & 11th centuries created internal chaos andfaminesthroughout theMiddle East, as well as population decline.[75]Michael Ehrlich argues that the decline in urban centers likely caused localecclesiasticaladministrations to weaken or disappear altogether, leaving Christians most susceptible to conversion. When certain urban centers collapsed, surrounding communities would have converted to Islam.[71]Per Ellenblum, the easternGalileeand centralSamaria, where Jews and Samaritans were concentrated respectively, were converted rather quickly and had a Muslim or Jewish-Muslim majority by the crusader period.[71][76]In Samaria, the sedentarization of nomadic tribes that penetrated Samaria was complemented by the mass conversion of theSamaritanpopulation starting from theTulunidperiod (884–905).[77]By the 12th century, central Samaria was the only fully Islamized region in Palestine, while Christians predominated in southern Samaria, theSinjil-Jerusalemarea, the western Galilee and theHebron Hills, which only converted in later periods.[76]The introduction of Islam in the Hebron hills is archaeologically attested in Jewish villages but not Christian ones, mainly inSusyaandEshtemoa, where the localsynagogueswere repurposed asmosques.[73]",
        "Coastal cities such asRamlaandAscalonthrived under theFatimids(969–1099), where many Shiite scholars sought refuge and Shiite shrines were built,[78]and the hinterland of Ramla was predominantly Muslim when the crusaders conquered it.[71]On the other hand,Sufisplayed an important role in the Islamization of the hinterland ofJerusalem, where they built many religious buildings during the Mamluk period, transforming the cultural landscape. According to Nimrod Luz, when a Sufi settled in a Christian village, the local population often converted to Islam.[79][80][81]According to Reuven Atimal, conversion toIslamappears to have halted and apparently even been reversed under theKingdom of Jerusalem(1099–1291). With the advent of theAyyubids(1187–1260) and then the consequentMamluk takeover(1260–1517), it appears that the process of religious conversion to Islam was accelerated. By the start of theOttoman periodin 1516, it is commonly thought that the Muslim majority in the country was more-or-less like that of the mid-19th century.[82]Conversion among the Samaritan families ofNablusto Islam continued well into the 19th century.[83][84]",
        "During the first century of the Ottoman rule, i.e., 1550,Bernard Lewisin a study of Ottoman registers of the early Ottoman Rule of Palestine reports a population of around 300,000:[85][86]",
        "From the mass of detail in the registers, it is possible to extract something like a general picture of the economic life of the country in that period. Out of a total population of about 300,000 souls, between a fifth and a quarter lived in the six towns ofJerusalem,Gaza,Safed,Nablus,Ramle, andHebron. The remainder consisted mainly of peasants (fellahin), living in villages of varying size, and engaged in agriculture. Their main food-crops were wheat and barley in that order, supplemented by leguminous pulses, olives, fruit, and vegetables. In and around most of the towns there was a considerable number of vineyards, orchards, and vegetable gardens.",
        "According toJustin McCarthy, the population of Palestine throughout the 17th and 18th centuries (1601–1801) was likely not much smaller than when it in 1850 (~340,000), after which it started to increase.[87][page needed]",
        "In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, there were several migration waves ofEgyptiansto Palestine. One notable influx occurred in the 1780s due to a severe famine in Egypt.\nThe main migration wave happened between 1829 and 1841, whenMuhammad AliandIbrahim Pashainvaded Palestine, some Egyptian settlers and army dropouts stayed in Palestine after Egyptian retreat. These migrants primarily settled in the low country: in theBeisanarea,Wadi Araba, theJezreel valley, theShephelah, the coastal plain and theNegevdesert.[88]This represented the largest migrant group prior to the Jewish migratory waves, with David Grossman estimating the total number between 23,000 and 30,000 people.[89]Algerianrefugees (\"Maghrebis\") also arrived in Palestine in the 1850s followingAbdelkader's rebellion.[90]",
        "In the late nineteenth century, prior to the rise of Zionism, Jews are thought to have comprised between 2% and 5% of the population of Palestine, although the precise population is not known.[91]Jewish immigration had begun following the 1839Tanzimatreforms; between 1840 and 1880, the Jewish population of Palestine rose from 9,000 to 23,000.[92]",
        "According toAlexander Scholch, Palestine in 1850 had about 350,000 inhabitants, 30% of whom lived in 13 towns; roughly 85% were Muslims, 11% were Christians and 4% Jews.[93]",
        "The Ottoman census of 1878 indicated the following demographics for the three districts that best approximated what later becameMandatory Palestine; that is, theMutasarrifate of Jerusalem, theNablus Sanjak, and theAcre Sanjak.[91]In addition, some scholars estimate approximately 5,000-10,000 additional foreign-born Jews at this time:[94]",
        "According toOttomanstatistics studied byJustin McCarthy,[95]the population of Palestine in the early 19th century was 350,000, in 1860 it was 411,000 and in 1900 about 600,000 of which 94% wereArabs.",

        "Based on the work ofRoberto Bachi,Sergio Della Pergolaestimated that Palestine's population in 1914 was 689,000, comprising 525,000 Muslims, 94,000 Jews, and 70,000 Christians.[3]",
        "According to another estimate, the Jewish population in 1914 was 85,000 and subsequently fell to 56,000 in 1916–1919[99]as a result ofWorld War I. During the war, the Ottoman authorities deported many Jews with foreign citizenship, while others left after they were presented with a choice of taking Ottoman citizenship or leaving Palestine. By December 1915 about 14% of the Jewish population had left, mainly forEgypt, where they awaited the war's end so they could return to Palestine.[100]",
        "According to Dr. Mutaz M. Qafisheh, the number of people who held Ottoman citizenship prior to the British Mandate in 1922 was just over 729,873, of which 7,143 were Jews.[101]Qafisheh calculated this using population and immigration statistics from the 1946 Survey of Palestine, as well as the fact that 37,997 people acquired provisional Palestinian naturalization certificates in September 1922 for the purpose of voting in the legislative election,[102]of which all but 100 were Jews.[103]The1922 census of Palestinelists 3,210 Christians as members of Armenian churches, 271 beingArmenian Catholic(176 in Jerusalem-Jaffa, 10 in Samaria, and 85 in Northern) and 2,939 beingArmenian Apostolic(11 in Southern, 2,800 in Jerusalem-Jaffa, eight in Samaria, and 120 in Northern) along with 2,970 Armenian speakers, including 2,906 in municipal areas (2,442 in Jerusalem, 216 inJaffa, 101 inHaifa, four inGaza, 13 inNablus, one inSafad, 20 in Nazareth, 13 inRamleh, one inTiberias, 37 in Bethlehem, 25 inAcre, four inTulkarem, 21 inRamallah, six inJenin, one inBeersheba, and one inBaisan).[104]",

        "There are now in the whole of Palestine hardly 700,000 people, a population much less than that of the province of Gallilee alone in the time of Christ. Of these 235,000 live in the larger towns, 465,000 in the smaller towns and villages. Four-fifths of the whole population are Moslems. A small proportion of these are Bedouin Arabs; the remainder, although they speak Arabic and are termed Arabs, are largely of mixed race. Some 77,000 of the population are Christians, in large majority belonging to the Orthodox Church, and speaking Arabic. The minority are members of the Latin or of the Uniate Greek Catholic Church, or—a small number—are Protestants.\nThe Jewish element of the population numbers 76,000. Almost all have entered Palestine during the last 40 years. Prior to 1850 there were in the country only a handful of Jews. In the following 30 years a few hundreds came to Palestine. Most of them were animated by religious motives; they came to pray and to die in the Holy Land, and to be buried in its soil. After the persecutions in Russia forty years ago, the movement of the Jews to Palestine assumed larger proportions. Jewish agricultural colonies were founded. They developed the culture of oranges and gave importance to the Jaffa orange trade. They cultivated the vine, and manufactured and exported wine. They drained swamps. They planted eucalyptus trees. They practised, with modern methods, all the processes of agriculture. There are at the present time 64 of these settlements, large and small, with a population of some 15,000.[105]",

        "At the end of the 18th century, there was a bi-directional movement betweenEgyptand Palestine. Between 1829 and 1841, thousands of Egyptianfellahin(peasants) arrived in Palestine fleeingMuhammad Ali Pasha's conscription, which he reasoned as thecasus bellitoinvade Palestinein October 1831, ostensibly to repatriate the Egyptian fugitives.[107][108][109]Egyptian forced labourers, mostly from theNile Delta, were brought in by Muhammad Ali and settled insakināt(neighborhoods) along the coast for agriculture, which set off bad blood with the indigenousfellahin, who resented Muhammad Ali's plans and interference, prompting the wide-scalePeasants' revolt in Palestinein 1834.[107][110][111]After Egyptian defeat and retreat in 1841, many laborers and deserters stayed in Palestine.[108]Most of these settled and were quickly assimilated in the cities ofJaffaandGaza, theCoastal plainsandWadi Ara.[108]Estimates of Egyptian migrants during this period generally place them at 15,000–30,000.[108]At the time, the sedentary population of Palestine fluctuated around 350,000.[108]Palestine experienced a few waves of immigration of Muslims from the lands lost by the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century. Algerians, Circassians and Bosniaks were mostly settled on vacant land and unlike the Egyptians they did not alter the geography of settlement significantly.[108]: 73",
        "TheNaqabdesert further south preserved its Bedouin population, who had reportedly lived in the area since the 7th century. Many Bedouin tribes moved from theHejazandTransjordanin the 14th and 15th centuries. According to the1922 census of Palestine, \"The Ottoman authorities in 1914 placed the tribal population ofBeershebaat 55,000, and since that date there has been a migration of tribes from the Hejaz and Southern Transjordan into theBeershebaarea mainly as a result of succession of adequate rainfalls and of pressure exerted by other tribes east of the River Jordan.\" For 1922, the census gives a figure of 74,910 including 72,998 in the tribal areas.[112]",
        "DemographerUziel Schmelz, in his analysis of Ottoman registration data for 1905 populations of Jerusalem and Hebronkazas, found that most Ottoman citizens living in these areas, comprising about one quarter of the population of Palestine, were living at the place where they were born. Specifically, of Muslims, 93.1% were born in their current locality of residence, 5.2% were born elsewhere in Palestine, and 1.6% were born outside Palestine. Of Christians, 93.4% were born in their current locality, 3.0% were born elsewhere in Palestine, and 3.6% were born outside Palestine. Of Jews (excluding the large fraction who were not Ottoman citizens), 59.0% were born in their current locality, 1.9% were born elsewhere in Palestine, and 39.0% were born outside Palestine.[113]",
        "According toRoberto Bachi, head of the Israeli Institute of  Statistics from 1949 onwards, between 1922 and 1945 there was a net Arab migration into Palestine of between 40,000 and 42,000, excluding 9,700 people who were incorporated after territorial adjustments were made to the borders in the 1920s. Based on these figures, and including those netted by the border alterations, Joseph Melzer  calculates an upper boundary of 8.5% for Arab growth in the two decades, and interprets it to mean the local Palestinian community's growth was generated primarily by natural increase inbirth rates, for both Muslims and Christians.[114]",
        "According to aJewish Agencysurvey, 77% of Palestinian population growth in Palestine between 1914 and 1938, during which the Palestinian population doubled, was due to natural increase, while 23% was due to immigration. Arab immigration was primarily fromLebanon,Syria, Transjordan, and Egypt (all countries that bordered Palestine).[115]",
        "The overall assessment of several British reports was that the increase in the Arab population was primarily due to natural increase.[116][117]These included theHope Simpson Enquiry(1930),[118]thePassfield White Paper(1930),[119]thePeel Commissionreport (1937),[120]and the Survey of Palestine (1945).[121]However, the Hope Simpson Enquiry did note that there was significant illegal immigration from the surrounding Arab territories,[118]while the Peel Commission and Survey of Palestine claimed that immigration played only a minor role in the growth of the Arab population. The1931 census of Palestineconsidered the question of illegal immigration since the previous census in 1922.[122]It estimated that unrecorded immigration during that period may have amounted to 9,000 Jews and 4,000 Arabs.[122]It also gave the proportion of persons living in Palestine in 1931 who were born outside Palestine: Muslims, 2%; Christians, 20%; Jews, 58%.[122]The statistical information for Arab immigration (and expulsions when the clandestine migrants were caught), with a contrast to the figures for Jewish immigration over the same period of 1936–1939, is given byHenry Laurensin the following terms[123]",
        "According to Mark Tessler, at least some of the Arab population growth was the result of immigration, mostly from the Sinai, Lebanon, Syria, and Transjordan, stimulated by the relatively favorable economic conditions in Palestine, but he noted differing opinions among scholars over how substantial it was. He cited one study as putting the Arab population growth attributable to immigration between 1922 and 1931 at 7%, meaning that 4% of the Arab population in 1931 was foreign-born, while noting another estimate[124]put the growth in the Arab population attributable to immigration at 38.7%, which would mean that 11.8% of the Arab population in 1931 was foreign-born. Tessler wrote that \"Israeli as well as Palestinian scholars have disputed this assertion, however, concluding that it is at best a theory and in all probability a myth.\"[125]",
        "In a 1974 study, demographer Roberto Bachi estimated that about 900 Muslims per year were detected as illegal immigrants but not deported.[126]He noted the impossibility of estimating illegal immigration that was undetected, or the fraction of those persons who eventually departed.[126]He did note that there was an unexplained increase in the Muslim population between 1922 and 1931, and he did suggest, though qualifying it as a \"mere guess\", that this was due to a combination of unrecorded immigration (using the 1931 census report estimate) and undercounting in the 1922 census.[126]",
        "While noting the uncertainty of earlier data, Bachi also observed that the Muslim population growth in the 19th century appeared to be high by world standards:",
        "\"[B]etween 1800 and 1914, the Muslim population had a yearly average increase of an order of magnitude of roughly 6–7 per thousand. This can be compared to the very crude estimate of about 4 per thousand for the \"less developed countries\" of the world (in Asia, Africa, and Latin America) between 1800 and 1910. It is possible that some part of the growth of the Muslim population was due to immigration. However, it seems likely that the dominant determinant of this modest growth was the beginning of some natural increase.\"[127]",
        "According toJustin McCarthy, \"evidence for Muslim immigration into Palestine is minimal. Because no Ottoman records of that immigration have yet been discovered, one is thrown back on demographic analysis to evaluate Muslim migration.\"[128]McCarthy argues that there was no significant Arab immigration into mandatory Palestine:",
        "From analyses of rates of increase of the Muslim population of the three Palestinian sanjaks, one can say with certainty that Muslim immigration after the 1870s was small. Had there been a large group of Muslim immigrants their numbers would have caused an unusual increase in the population and this would have appeared in the calculated rate of increase from one registration list to another ... Such an increase would have been easily noticed; it was not there.[129]",
        "The argument that Arab immigration somehow made up a large part of the Palestinian Arab population is thus statistically untenable. The vast majority of the Palestinian Arabs resident in 1947 were the sons and daughters of Arabs who were living in Palestine before modern Jewish immigration began. There is no reason to believe that they were not the sons and daughters of Arabs who had been in Palestine for many centuries.[130]",
        "McCarthy also concludes that there was no significant internal migration to Jewish areas attributable to better economic conditions:",
        "Some areas of Palestine did experience greater population growth than others, but the explanation for this is simple. Radical economic change was occurring all over the Mediterranean Basin at the time. Improved transportation, greater mercantile activity, and greater industry had increased the chances for employment in cities, especially coastal cities... Differential population increase was occurring all over the Eastern Mediterranean, not just in Palestine... The increase in Muslim population had little or nothing to do with Jewish immigration. In fact the province that experienced the greatest Jewish population growth (by .035 annually), Jerusalem Sanjak, was the province with the lowest rate of growth of Muslim population (.009).[131]",
        "Fred M. Gottheil has questioned McCarthy's estimates of immigration. Gottheil says that McCarthy didn't give proper weight to the importance of economic incentives at the time, and that McCarthy cites Roberto Bachi's estimates as conclusive numbers, rather than lower bounds based on detected illegal immigration.[124][132]",
        "Gad Gilbar has also concluded that the prosperity of Palestine in the 45–50 years before World War I was a result of the modernization and growth of the economy owing to its integration with the world economy and especially with the economies of Europe. Although the reasons for growth were exogenous to Palestine the bearers were not waves of Jewish immigration, foreign intervention nor Ottoman reforms but \"primarily local Arab Muslims and Christians.\"[133]However, Gilbar did attribute the rapid growth of Jaffa and Haifa in the final three decades of Ottoman rule in part to migration, writing that \"both attracted population from the rural and urban surroundings and immigrants from outside Palestine.\"[134]",
        "Yehoshua Porathbelieves that the notion of \"large-scale immigration of Arabs from the neighboring countries\" is a myth \"proposed by Zionist writers\". He writes:",
        "As all the research by historian Fares Abdul Rahim and geographers of modern Palestine shows, the Arab population began to grow again in the middle of the nineteenth century. That growth resulted from a new factor: the demographic revolution. Until the 1850s there was no \"natural\" increase of the population, but this began to change when modern medical treatment was introduced and modern hospitals were established, both by the Ottoman authorities and by the foreign Christian missionaries. The number of births remained steady but infant mortality decreased. This was the main reason for Arab population growth. ... No one would doubt that some migrant workers came to Palestine from Syria and Trans-Jordan and remained there. But one has to add to this that there were migrations in the opposite direction as well. For example, a tradition developed in Hebron to go to study and work in Cairo, with the result that a permanent community of Hebronites had been living in Cairo since the fifteenth century. Trans-Jordan exported unskilled casual labor to Palestine; but before 1948 its civil service attracted a good many educated Palestinian Arabs who did not find work in Palestine itself. Demographically speaking, however, neither movement of population was significant in comparison to the decisive factor of natural increase.[135]",
        "As of 2014[update], Israeli and Palestinian statistics for the overall numbers of Jews and Arabs in the area west of the Jordan, inclusive of Israel and thePalestinian territories, are similar and suggest a rough parity in the two populations. Palestinian statistics estimate 6.1 million Palestinians for that area, while Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics estimates 6.2 million Jews living in sovereign Israel. Gaza is estimated by theIsraeli Defense Forces(IDF) to have 1.7 million, and the West Bank 2.8 million Palestinians, while Israel proper has 1.7 million Arab citizens.[136]According to Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, as of May 2006, of Israel's 7 million people, 77% wereJews, 18.5%Arabs, and 4.3% \"others\".[137]Among Jews, 68% wereSabras(Israeli-born), mostly second- or third-generation Israelis, and the rest areolim– 22% from Europe and the Americas, and 10% from Asia and Africa, including theArab countries.[138]",
        "According to these Israeli and Palestinian estimates, the population in Israel and the Palestinian territories stands at from 6.1 to 6.2 million Palestinians  and 6.1 million Jews.[136][failed verification]According toSergio DellaPergola, if foreign workers and non-Jewish Russian immigrants in Israel are subtracted, Jews are already a minority in the land between the river and the sea.[136]DellaPergola calculates that Palestinians as of January 2014 number 5.7 million as opposed to a \"core Jewish population\" of 6.1 million.[136]",
        "The Palestinian statistics are contested by some right-wing Israeli think-tanks and non-demographers such as Yoram Ettinger, who claim they overestimate Palestinian numbers by double-counting and counting Palestinians who live abroad. The double-counting  argument is dismissed by bothArnon Soffer,Ian Lustick[139]and DellaPergola, the latter dismissing Ettinger's calculations as 'delusional' or manipulated for ignoring the birth-rate differentials between the two populations (3 children per Jewish mother vs 3.4 for Palestinians generally, and 4.1 in the Gaza Strip). DellaPergola allows, however, for an inflation in the Palestinian statistics due to the counting of Palestinians who are abroad, a discrepancy of some 380,000 individuals.[136]",

The expulsion of Jews from the area of Jerusalem following the suppression of the revolt, in combination with the penetration of pagan populations into the same region, created the conditions for the diffusion of Christians into that area during the fifth and sixth centuries.

Between 1880 and 1907, the number of Jews in Palestine grew from 23,000 to 80,000. Most of the community resided in Jerusalem, which already had a Jewish majority at the beginning of the influx. [Footnote: Mordecai Elia, Ahavar Tziyon ve-Kolel Hod (Tel Aviv, 1971), appendix A. Between 1840 and 1880 the Jewish settlement in Palestine grew in numbers from 9,000 to 23,000.] The First Aliyah accounted for only a few thousand of the new-comers, and the number of the Biluim among them was no more than a few dozen. Jewish immigration to Palestine had begun to swell in the 1840s, following the liberalization of Ottoman domestic policy (the Tanzimat Reforms) and as a result of the protection extended to immigrants by the European consulates set up at the time in Jerusalem and Jaffa. The majority of immigrants came from Eastern and Central Europe – the Russian Empire, Romania, and Hungary – and were not inspired by modern Zionist ideology. Many were motivated by a blend of traditional ideology (e.g., belief in the sanctity of the land of Israel and in the redemption of the Jewish people through the return to Zion) and practical considerations (e.g., desire to escape the worsening conditions in their lands of origin and to improve their lot in Palestine). The proto-Zionist ideas which had already crystallized in Western Europe during the late 1850s and early 1860s were gaining currency in Eastern Europe.",

Figures in thousands. [ 3 ] The population of the region of Palestine , which approximately corresponds to modern Israel and the Palestine , has varied in both size and ethnic composition throughout the history of Palestine . Studies of Palestine's demographic changes over the millennia have shown that a Jewish majority in the first century AD had changed to a Christian majority by the 3rd century AD, [ 4 ] and later to a Muslim majority, which is thought to have existed in Mandatory Palestine (1920-1948) since at least the 12th century AD, during which the total shift to Arabic language was completed. [ 5 ] Iron Age See also: Canaan § Archaeology and history , and History of ancient Israel and Judah During the seventh century BC, no fewer than eight nations were settled in Palestine. These included the Arameans of the kingdom of Geshur ; the Samaritans who replaced the Israelite kingdom in Samaria ; the Phoenicians in the northern cities and parts of Galilee ; the Philistines in the Philistine pentapolis ; the three kingdoms of the Transjordan – Ammon , Moab and Edom ; and the Judaeans of Kingdom of Judah . [ 6 ] According to Finkelstein and Broshi, the population of Palestine at the end of the eighth century BC was around 400,000. In the area of Judah in the central hills, Benjamin and Jerusalem , the population was approximately 110,000. By the early sixth century, Ofer's survey results suggest that around 100,000 lived in the kingdom of Judah, with the population in the central hills, Benjamin and Jerusalem about 69,000. [ 7 ] A study by Yigal Shiloh of The Hebrew University suggests that the population of Palestine in the Iron Age could have never exceeded one million. He writes: \"... the population of the country in the Roman-Byzantine period greatly exceeded that in the Iron Age...\" Shiloh accepted Israeli archaeologist Magen Broshi's estimates of Palestine's population at 1,000,000–1,250,000 and noted that Iron Age Israel's population must have been less considering population growth. \"...If we accept Broshi's population estimates, which appear to be confirmed by the results of recent research, it follows that the estimates for the population during the Iron Age must be set at a lower figure.\" [ 8 ] One study of population growth from 1000 BC to 750 BC estimated the population of Palestine ( Judah and Israel ) had an average natural growth of 0.4 per cent per annum. [ 9 ] Persian period See also: Yehud Medinata Population distribution in Persian period Yehud Territory Carter Lipschits Finkelstein Benjamin 7625 12,500 - Jerusalem (and environs) 1500 2750 400 [ fn 1 ] Northern Judean Hills 8850 9750 - Southern Judean Hills 2150 - - Shephelah - 4875 - Judean Desert/Eastern Strip 525 250 - Total 20,650 30,125 12,000 Lipshits' data from The Fall and Rise of Jerusalem: Judah under Babylonian Rule , Carter's data from The Emergence of Yehud in the Persian Period , Finkelstein's data from The Territorial Extent and Demography of Yehud/Judea After the Babylonian conquest of Judah and exile, the population and settlement density of Jerusalem , the Shephelah and the Naqab desert dropped significantly. [ 10 ] The Persian province of Yehud Medinata was sparsely-populated and predominantly rural, with around half of the settlements of late Iron age Judah and a population of around 30,000 in the 5th to 4th centuries BC. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] On the other hand, settlement continuity is discerned in the northern parts of the Judean mountains and the Benjamin area . Cities such as Tell en-Nasbeh , Gibeon and Bethel managed to escape destruction and remained continuously inhabited until the early Achaemenid rule . [ 10 ] As early as the 7th century BC, Edomites had lived in the Naqab desert and southern Judah, and by the time Judah fell in 586 BC there was already a substantial Edomite population in southern Judah. When the kingdom of Edom itself succumbed, those people continued its traditions in the south, which the Arabic-speaking Qedarites controlled. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 10 ] [ 15 ] This area, which became known as Idumaea, was inhabited by a diverse population of Edomites, Judahites, Phoenicians, Qedarites and other Arabs. [ 16 ] Based on analysis of epigraphic material and ostraca from the region, around 32% of recorded names were Arabic , 27% were Edomite , 25% were Northwest Semitic , 10% were Judahite ( Hebrew ) and 5% were Phoenician . [ 17 ] A few names were also classified Egyptian and Old Iranian . [ 14 ] The exilic returnees resettled during the time of Cyrus the Great , perhaps with a heightened sense of their ethnic identity. [ 10 ] Along the coast of western Palestine, the Phoenicians expanded their presence, while Moabites and Ammonites took refuge in the Cisjordan after the destruction of their kingdoms in 582 BC. [ 10 ] Hellenistic and Hasmonean period Following the Macedonian conquest of the Achaemenid Empire and the subsequent Wars of the Diadochi , Palestine came under Hellenistic rule and was contested by the Seleucids and Ptolemaics . [ 18 ] Between 167 and 160 BC, the Jewish rebel faction of the Maccabees revolted against Seleucid rule, ultimately leading to the independence of the Hasmonean dynasty . Under John Hyrcanus , the Hasmoneans expanded their territories beyond the traditional confines of Judea and incorporated non-Jewish areas in the process. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] 1 Maccabees relates that the non-Jewish inhabitants of Gezer and Joppa were expelled by Simon Thassi , who settled Jews in their place. [ 23 ] Coinciding with the account of Josephus , archaeological evidence attests to significant destruction in the urban and rural settlements in Idumaea, Samaria and the coastal cities from the Hasmonean conquests, followed by the resettlement of Jews in the newly conquered territories. [ 24 ] Nevertheless, there's evidence that some of the non-Jewish inhabitants stayed in all of the newly conquered areas. [ 19 ] Many sites in Idumaea experienced destruction, including Maresha , Khirbet el-Rasm, Tel Arad , Khirbet 'Uza and possibly Lachish . The lower city of Maresha and Tel Beersheba were soon abandoned, and evidence for an increased Idumaean presence in Egypt suggests some immigrated there. Idumaeans were eventually forcibly proselytized and co-opted into the Jewish nation by John Hyrcanus. [ 19 ] Further north, the Galilee received significant Jewish migration from Judea after its conquest, contributing to a 50% increase in settlements, while the pagan population was greatly reduced. By the end of Alexander Jannaeus ' reign, the Galilee was also predominantly Jewish. [ 25 ] However, unlike John Hyrcanus, Alexander Jannaeus did not compel the non-Jews to assimilate to the Jewish ethnos and permitted minority ethnē to exist within Hasmonean borders, with the exception of Phoenician coastal cities in the north whom Josephus claims he enslaved. Roman period See also: Syria Palaestina and Province of Judah § Administration and demographics The Roman conquest of Judea led by Pompey took place in 63 BC. The Roman occupation encompassed the end of Jewish independence in Judea, the last years of the Hasmonean kingdom, the Herodian age and the rise of Christianity , the First Jewish–Roman War , and the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the Second Temple . [ 26 ] The total population of Pharisees , the forerunners of modern Rabbinic Judaism , was around 6,000 (\"exakischilioi\"), according to Josephus . [ 27 ] Local population displacements occurred with the expulsion of the Jews from Jerusalem [ 28 ] – \"In the earlier revolt in the previous century, 66–73 CE, Rome destroyed the Temple and forbade Jews to live in the remaining parts of Jerusalem ; for this reason, the Rabbis gathered instead on the Mediterranean coast in Yavneh near Jaffa \". Dispersal to other parts of the Roman Empire occurred, but some earlier settlements were also established as early as 4 BC. [ 29 ] Modern estimates vary: Applebaum argues that in the Herodian kingdom , there were 1.5 million Jews, a figure Ben David says covers the numbers in Judea alone. Salo Wittmayer Baron estimated the population at 2.3 million at the time of Roman emperor Claudius (reigned 41–54). According to Israeli archeologist Magen Broshi, west of the Jordan River the population certainly did not exceed 1 million: [ 30 ] \"... the population of Palestine in antiquity did not exceed a million persons. It can also be shown, moreover, that this was more or less the size of the population in the peak period – the late Byzantine period, around AD 600\" [ 31 ] Broshi made calculations based on the grain-producing capacity of Palestine and on its role in the indigenous diet, assuming an average annual per-capita consumption of 200 kg. (with a maximum of 250 kg.), which would work out to the limit of a sustainable population of 1,000,000 people, a figure which, Broshi states, remained roughly constant down to the end of the Byzantine period (600 CE). [ 32 ] The proportion of Jews to gentiles is also unknown. [ 30 ] The Bar Kokhba revolt in the 2nd century saw a major shift in the population of Palestine. The sheer scale and scope of the overall destruction, according to a late epitome of Dio Cassius 's Roman History , where he states that Roman war operations in the country had left some 580,000 Jews dead, with many more dying of hunger and disease, while 50 of their most important outposts and 985 of their most famous villages were razed to the ground. \"Thus,\" writes Dio Cassius, \"nearly the whole of Judaea was made desolate.\" [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Goodblatt contends that while Bar Kokhba rendered much of the Judaean Mountains and the Hebron Hills desolate, Jewish communities continued to thrive in other parts of Judea and Palestine as a whole. \"The destruction of the Jewish metropolis of Jerusalem and its environs and the ventual refoundation of the city as the Roman colony of Aelia Capitolina had lasting repercussions. However, in other parts of Palestine the Jewish population remained strong. Literary and archaeological evidence indicates that in the Late Roman-early Byzantine era Jewish commuinities thrived along the eastern, southern and western edges of Judah , in the Galilee , Golan and the Beit Shean region. And a strong Jewish presence continued throughout this period in many poleis , including Caesarea Maritima and Scythopolis.\" [ 35 ] When exactly Jews became a minority is disputed. [ 30 ] [ 35 ] Eschel argues that a combination of three events: the rise of Christianity , the Jewish-Roman wars and Jewish Diaspora made Jews in the minority. [ 36 ] David Goodblatt contends that Jews suffered a setback following the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136), noting that Jews were still in the majority until the 3rd century and even beyond, when Christianity became the empire's official religion, and continued to thrive in different parts of Palestine. [ 35 ] According to Doron Bar, archaeological evidence of synagogue remains demonstrate a central Jewish presence throughout Palestine during the entire Byzantine period. [ 37 ] The 'ascension' of Constantine the Great in 312 and Christianity becoming the official state religion of Rome in 391, consequently brought to an end Jewish dominance in Palestine. [ 38 ] Already by the mid-3rd century the Jewish majority had been reported to have been lost, while others conclude that a Jewish majority lasted much longer – \"What does seem clear is a different kind of change – immigration of Christians and the conversion of pagans, Samaritans, and Jews eventually produced a Christian majority\". [ 4 ] After the Bar Kokhba revolt of 132–136 CE the make-up of the population of Palestine remains in doubt due to the sparsity of data in the historical record. Figures vary considerably as to the demographics of Palestine in the Christian era. [ 39 ] No reliable data exist on the population of Palestine in the pre-Muslim period, either in absolute terms or in terms of shares of total population. Although many Jews were killed, expelled or sold off into slavery after the AD 66–70 and the 123–125 rebellions, the degree to which these transfers affected the Jewish dominance in Palestine is rarely addressed. What is certain is that Palestine did not lose its Jewish component. Goldblatt [ 4 ] concludes that the Jews may have remained a majority into the 3rd century AD and even beyond. He notes that 'Jewish followers of Jesus' (Jewish Christians) would not have taken part in the rebellions. Moreover, non-Christian conversions from Judaism after the Bar Kochba revolt were not given much attention. \"Indeed, many must have reacted to the catastrophe with despair and total abandonment of Judaism. Apostates from Judaism (aside from converts to Christianity) received little notice in antiquity from either Jewish or non-Jewish writers, but ambitious individuals are known to have turned pagan before the war, and it stands to reason that many more did so after its disastrous conclusion. It is impossible to determine the number who joined the budding Christian movement and the number who disappeared into the polytheist majority.\" [ 40 ] Byzantine period Byzantine provinces of Palestine The administrative reorganization of the region in 284–305 AD by the Eastern Romans produced three Palestinian provinces of \"Greater Palestine\" which lasted from the 4th to the early 7th centuries: Palaestina Prima , which included the historic regions of Philistia , Judea and Samaria with the capital in Caesarea Maritima ; Palaestina Secunda , which included the Galilee , the Golan Heights , as well as parts of Perea (western Transjordan) and the Decapolis , with its capital being Scythopolis ; and Palaestina Salutaris which included Idumaea , the Naqab desert , Arabia Petraea , parts of Sinai , and Transjordan south of the Dead Sea , with its capital in Petra . [ 41 ] [ 5 ] Under the Byzantines, the religious landscape of Palestine underwent a significant transformation, propelled by the widescale Christianization of the local Jewish, pagan and Samaritan communities, as well as immigration of Christian pilgrims and monks into the Holy land. [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] After the failure of Bar Kokhba revolt in 135, Jews were barred from living in a large part of former Judaea. [ 46 ] During this period, Jews were concentrated in the Galilee , the Golan and marginal areas of the Judaean hills , [ 47 ] between Eleutheropolis and Hebron in the Daromas, [ 46 ] with significant Jewish settlement in the strip between Ein Gedi and Ascalon . [ 43 ] Jews also lived in the southern Jordan Valley near Jericho , where they were employed in date and Balsam plantations; around Narbata, in Samaria and in the Jezreel Valley . However, the main centres of Jewish life and culture during this period were the cosmopolitan cities of the coastal plains, particularly Lydda , Jamnia , Azotus and Caesarea Maritima . [ 46 ] Samaritans , originally concentrated in communities around Mount Gerizim , had spread beyond Samaria proper in the second century and established communities in the coastal plains, Judea and the Galilee, with some Samaritan villages located as far as Golan. [ 43 ] However, the Samaritan revolts against the Byzantines in 484–573 and their forced conversion to Christianity under Maurice (582–602) and Heraclius (610–641) significantly diminished their numbers. [ 45 ] [ 44 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ] Pagan tradition flourished in the period before Constantine , [ 46 ] and pagans were a majority in the coastal plains, [ 47 ] Judea, Samaria , the Naqab and much of the urban centers. [ 43 ] [ 52 ] Although proscribed in the Bible , pagan cults had thrived in Palestine throughout the First and Second Temple period, and many Jews did not escape it. [ 53 ] [ 46 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ] [ 56 ] According to E. Friedheim, many Jews in Palestine also embraced paganism and pagan cults again following the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD. [ 57 ] Talmudic tradition forbid customs relating to 'the Amorite ways', showing a persistence of ancient Canaanite customs among the non-Jewish population and their inconsistent penetration into Jewish circles. [ 55 ] Christian presence at the start of this period was mainly evidenced in Hellenistic cities and some of the villages in southern Judea. [ 43 ] However, Christianity's early influence in either the Jewish, Samaritan or pagan rural areas was minor and came at a much later stage around the sixth century, when many of the community churches in Judea , western Galilee , the Naqab and other places were built. [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 37 ] [ 60 ] By the fifth century, many pagan temples in Palestine including those in Jerusalem, Bethlehem , Mamre , Tel Qadesh and Tel Dan , had been demolished, and churches were erected in their place. [ 42 ] [ 58 ] [ 61 ] [ 59 ] In the rural sector, vast areas of Palestine, such as Galilee and Samaria , had Jewish and Samaritan majorities, and Christianity spread in these areas far more gradually and at a slower pace, achieving real momentum only during the second half of the Byzantine period. [ 37 ] [ 62 ] [ 35 ] Christianity had also spread in the Nabataean cities, towns and villages in southern Palestine, where a mixed Christian and pagan population lived, with elaborate churches built in Abdah , Mampsis and Subeita . [ 63 ] Palestine reached its peak population of around 1 to 1.5 million during this period. However, estimates of the relative proportions of Jews, Samaritans and pagans vary widely and are speculative. By counting settlements, Avi-Yonah estimated that Jews comprised half the population of the Galilee at the end of the 3rd century, and a quarter in the other parts of the country, but had declined to 10–15% of the total by 614. [ 4 ] On the other hand, by counting churches and synagogues , Tsafrir estimated the Jewish proportion to be 25% in the Byzantine period. [ 4 ] Stemberger, however, considers that Jews were the largest population group at the beginning of the 4th century, closely followed by the pagans. [ 64 ] According to Schiffman, DellaPergola and Bar, Christians only became the majority of the country's population at the beginning of the fifth century, [ 65 ] [ 66 ] [ 58 ] Medieval Islamic Period Main articles: Islam in Palestine , Kingdom of Jerusalem § Crusader society and demographics , and Ayyubid § Demographics Early Islamic Syria ( Bilad al-Sham ) and its provinces under the Abbasids in the 9th century Prior to the Muslim conquest of Palestine (635–640), Palaestina Prima had a population of 700 thousand, of which around 100 thousand were Jews and 30 to 80 thousand were Samaritans, [ 67 ] with the remainder being Chalcedonian and Miaphysite Christians. [ 5 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] Arabs came to constitute a ruling minority in Palestine who despised farming and kept their nomadic lifestyle, with the tribes of Lakhm , Judham , Kinana , Khath'am , Khuza'a , and Azd Sarat forming the army of Jund Filastin (military district of Palestine). [ 70 ] The pace of conversion to Islam among the various Christian, Jewish, and Samaritan communities in Palestine varied during the early period (638–1098), [ 71 ] and opinions vary regarding the extent of Islamization during the early Islamic period. [ 72 ] Some argue Palestine was already majority Muslim by the time of arrival of the First Crusade , [ 71 ] while others contend that Christians were still in the majority and the process of mass adoption of Islam took place only from the 13th century onwards, during the Mamluk period . [ 73 ] According to archaeologist Gideon Avni, archaeological surveys show that most Christian settlements and sites preserved their identity up to the crusader period, supplemented by the numerosity of churches and monasteries all over Palestine. [ 73 ] The early Muslim population, on the other hand, was confined to the Umayyad palaces in the Jordan Valley and around the Sea of Galilee , the ribat fortresses along the coast and the farms of the Naqab desert . Thus, conversion to Islam only gained real momentum in Palestine after Saladin 's conquest of Jerusalem in 1187 and the expulsion of Franks . [ 73 ] Arabic gradually replaced Palestinian Aramaic and largely by the 9th century, while Islamization was only finalized in the Mamluk period. [ 74 ] Urban centers continued to flourish after the Islamic conquest, but changes took place in the 9th and 10th centuries. [ 63 ] [ 73 ] According to Ellenblum, climate disasters and earthquakes in the late 10th & 11th centuries created internal chaos and famines throughout the Middle East , as well as population decline. [ 75 ] Michael Ehrlich argues that the decline in urban centers likely caused local ecclesiastical administrations to weaken or disappear altogether, leaving Christians most susceptible to conversion. When certain urban centers collapsed, surrounding communities would have converted to Islam. [ 71 ] Per Ellenblum, the eastern Galilee and central Samaria , where Jews and Samaritans were concentrated respectively, were converted rather quickly and had a Muslim or Jewish-Muslim majority by the crusader period. [ 71 ] [ 76 ] In Samaria, the sedentarization of nomadic tribes that penetrated Samaria was complemented by the mass conversion of the Samaritan population starting from the Tulunid period (884–905). [ 77 ] By the 12th century, central Samaria was the only fully Islamized region in Palestine, while Christians predominated in southern Samaria, the Sinjil - Jerusalem area, the western Galilee and the Hebron Hills , which only converted in later periods. [ 76 ] The introduction of Islam in the Hebron hills is archaeologically attested in Jewish villages but not Christian ones, mainly in Susya and Eshtemoa , where the local synagogues were repurposed as mosques . [ 73 ] Coastal cities such as Ramla and Ascalon thrived under the Fatimids (969–1099), where many Shiite scholars sought refuge and Shiite shrines were built, [ 78 ] and the hinterland of Ramla was predominantly Muslim when the crusaders conquered it. [ 71 ] On the other hand, Sufis played an important role in the Islamization of the hinterland of Jerusalem , where they built many religious buildings during the Mamluk period, transforming the cultural landscape. According to Nimrod Luz, when a Sufi settled in a Christian village, the local population often converted to Islam. [ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] According to Reuven Atimal, conversion to Islam appears to have halted and apparently even been reversed under the Kingdom of Jerusalem (1099–1291). With the advent of the Ayyubids (1187–1260) and then the consequent Mamluk takeover (1260–1517), it appears that the process of religious conversion to Islam was accelerated. By the start of the Ottoman period in 1516, it is commonly thought that the Muslim majority in the country was more-or-less like that of the mid-19th century. [ 82 ] Conversion among the Samaritan families of Nablus to Islam continued well into the 19th century.

Early Ottoman period During the first century of the Ottoman rule, i.e., 1550, Bernard Lewis in a study of Ottoman registers of the early Ottoman Rule of Palestine reports a population of around 300,000: [ 85 ] [ 86 ] From the mass of detail in the registers, it is possible to extract something like a general picture of the economic life of the country in that period. Out of a total population of about 300,000 souls, between a fifth and a quarter lived in the six towns of Jerusalem , Gaza , Safed , Nablus , Ramle , and Hebron . The remainder consisted mainly of peasants ( fellahin ), living in villages of varying size, and engaged in agriculture. Their main food-crops were wheat and barley in that order, supplemented by leguminous pulses, olives, fruit, and vegetables. In and around most of the towns there was a considerable number of vineyards, orchards, and vegetable gardens. According to Justin McCarthy , the population of Palestine throughout the 17th and 18th centuries (1601–1801) was likely not much smaller than when it in 1850 (~340,000), after which it started to increase. [ 87 ] [ page needed ] Late Ottoman period In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, there were several migration waves of Egyptians to Palestine. One notable influx occurred in the 1780s due to a severe famine in Egypt.\nThe main migration wave happened between 1829 and 1841, when Muhammad Ali and Ibrahim Pasha invaded Palestine, some Egyptian settlers and army dropouts stayed in Palestine after Egyptian retreat. These migrants primarily settled in the low country: in the Beisan area, Wadi Araba , the Jezreel valley , the Shephelah , the coastal plain and the Negev desert. [ 88 ] This represented the largest migrant group prior to the Jewish migratory waves, with David Grossman estimating the total number between 23,000 and 30,000 people. [ 89 ] Algerian refugees (\" Maghrebis \") also arrived in Palestine in the 1850s following Abdelkader 's rebellion.

In the late nineteenth century, prior to the rise of Zionism, Jews are thought to have comprised between 2% and 5% of the population of Palestine, although the precise population is not known. [ 91 ] Jewish immigration had begun following the 1839 Tanzimat reforms; between 1840 and 1880, the Jewish population of Palestine rose from 9,000 to 23,000. [ 92 ] According to Alexander Scholch , Palestine in 1850 had about 350,000 inhabitants, 30% of whom lived in 13 towns; roughly 85% were Muslims, 11% were Christians and 4% Jews. [ 93 ] The Ottoman census of 1878 indicated the following demographics for the three districts that best approximated what later became Mandatory Palestine ; that is, the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem , the Nablus Sanjak , and the Acre Sanjak . [ 91 ] In addition, some scholars estimate approximately 5,000-10,000 additional foreign-born Jews at this time: [ 94 ] Group Population Percentage Muslim citizens 403,795 86–87% Christian citizens 43,659 9% Jewish citizens 15,011 3% Jewish (foreign-born) Est. 5–10,000 1–2% Total Up to 472,465 100.0% According to Ottoman statistics studied by Justin McCarthy , [ 95 ] the population of Palestine in the early 19th century was 350,000, in 1860 it was 411,000 and in 1900 about 600,000 of which 94% were Arabs . The estimated 24,000 Jews in Palestine in 1882 represented just 0.3% of the world's Jewish population.

[ 87 ] McCarthy estimates the non-Jewish population of Palestine at 452,789 in 1882, 737,389 in 1914, 725,507 in 1922, 880,746 in 1931 and 1,339,763 in 1946. [ 98 ] Based on the work of Roberto Bachi , Sergio Della Pergola estimated that Palestine's population in 1914 was 689,000, comprising 525,000 Muslims, 94,000 Jews, and 70,000 Christians. [ 3 ] According to another estimate, the Jewish population in 1914 was 85,000 and subsequently fell to 56,000 in 1916–1919 [ 99 ] as a result of World War I . During the war, the Ottoman authorities deported many Jews with foreign citizenship, while others left after they were presented with a choice of taking Ottoman citizenship or leaving Palestine. By December 1915 about 14% of the Jewish population had left, mainly for Egypt , where they awaited the war's end so they could return to Palestine. [ 100 ] According to Dr. Mutaz M. Qafisheh, the number of people who held Ottoman citizenship prior to the British Mandate in 1922 was just over 729,873, of which 7,143 were Jews. [ 101 ] Qafisheh calculated this using population and immigration statistics from the 1946 Survey of Palestine, as well as the fact that 37,997 people acquired provisional Palestinian naturalization certificates in September 1922 for the purpose of voting in the legislative election, [ 102 ] of which all but 100 were Jews. [ 103 ] The 1922 census of Palestine lists 3,210 Christians as members of Armenian churches, 271 being Armenian Catholic (176 in Jerusalem-Jaffa, 10 in Samaria, and 85 in Northern) and 2,939 being Armenian Apostolic (11 in Southern, 2,800 in Jerusalem-Jaffa, eight in Samaria, and 120 in Northern) along with 2,970 Armenian speakers, including 2,906 in municipal areas (2,442 in Jerusalem, 216 in Jaffa , 101 in Haifa , four in Gaza , 13 in Nablus , one in Safad , 20 in Nazareth, 13 in Ramleh , one in Tiberias , 37 in Bethlehem, 25 in Acre , four in Tulkarem , 21 in Ramallah , six in Jenin , one in Beersheba , and one in Baisan ).

( July 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In 1920, the British Government's Interim Report on the Civil Administration of Palestine stated that there were hardly 700,000 people living in Palestine: There are now in the whole of Palestine hardly 700,000 people, a population much less than that of the province of Gallilee alone in the time of Christ. Of these 235,000 live in the larger towns, 465,000 in the smaller towns and villages. Four-fifths of the whole population are Moslems. A small proportion of these are Bedouin Arabs; the remainder, although they speak Arabic and are termed Arabs, are largely of mixed race. Some 77,000 of the population are Christians, in large majority belonging to the Orthodox Church, and speaking Arabic. The minority are members of the Latin or of the Uniate Greek Catholic Church, or—a small number—are Protestants.\nThe Jewish element of the population numbers 76,000. Almost all have entered Palestine during the last 40 years. Prior to 1850 there were in the country only a handful of Jews. In the following 30 years a few hundreds came to Palestine. Most of them were animated by religious motives; they came to pray and to die in the Holy Land, and to be buried in its soil. After the persecutions in Russia forty years ago, the movement of the Jews to Palestine assumed larger proportions. Jewish agricultural colonies were founded. They developed the culture of oranges and gave importance to the Jaffa orange trade. They cultivated the vine, and manufactured and exported wine. They drained swamps. They planted eucalyptus trees. They practised, with modern methods, all the processes of agriculture. There are at the present time 64 of these settlements, large and small, with a population of some 15,000. [ 105 ] By 1948, the population had risen to 1,900,000, of whom 68% were Arabs , and 32% were Jews ( UNSCOP report, including Bedouin ).

In addition, there were a few places which, owing to technical difficulties, were not enumerated in the month of April.

Of these agricultural settlements, 32 are located in Judea, 12 in the Plain of Sharon, 32 are located in the Plain of Jesreel, 16 in Lower Galilee, and 9 in Upper Galilee. Most of them have a very small population – about one half being inhabited by less than 100 persons each.

Between 1829 and 1841, thousands of Egyptian fellahin (peasants) arrived in Palestine fleeing Muhammad Ali Pasha 's conscription, which he reasoned as the casus belli to invade Palestine in October 1831, ostensibly to repatriate the Egyptian fugitives. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] [ 109 ] Egyptian forced labourers, mostly from the Nile Delta , were brought in by Muhammad Ali and settled in sakināt (neighborhoods) along the coast for agriculture, which set off bad blood with the indigenous fellahin , who resented Muhammad Ali's plans and interference, prompting the wide-scale Peasants' revolt in Palestine in 1834. [ 107 ] [ 110 ] [ 111 ] After Egyptian defeat and retreat in 1841, many laborers and deserters stayed in Palestine. [ 108 ] Most of these settled and were quickly assimilated in the cities of Jaffa and Gaza , the Coastal plains and Wadi Ara . [ 108 ] Estimates of Egyptian migrants during this period generally place them at 15,000–30,000. [ 108 ] At the time, the sedentary population of Palestine fluctuated around 350,000. [ 108 ] Palestine experienced a few waves of immigration of Muslims from the lands lost by the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century. Algerians, Circassians and Bosniaks were mostly settled on vacant land and unlike the Egyptians they did not alter the geography of settlement significantly. [ 108 ] : 73 The Naqab desert further south preserved its Bedouin population, who had reportedly lived in the area since the 7th century. Many Bedouin tribes moved from the Hejaz and Transjordan in the 14th and 15th centuries. According to the 1922 census of Palestine , \"The Ottoman authorities in 1914 placed the tribal population of Beersheba at 55,000, and since that date there has been a migration of tribes from the Hejaz and Southern Transjordan into the Beersheba area mainly as a result of succession of adequate rainfalls and of pressure exerted by other tribes east of the River Jordan.\" For 1922, the census gives a figure of 74,910 including 72,998 in the tribal areas. [ 112 ] Demographer Uziel Schmelz , in his analysis of Ottoman registration data for 1905 populations of Jerusalem and Hebron kazas , found that most Ottoman citizens living in these areas, comprising about one quarter of the population of Palestine, were living at the place where they were born. Specifically, of Muslims, 93.1% were born in their current locality of residence, 5.2% were born elsewhere in Palestine, and 1.6% were born outside Palestine. Of Christians, 93.4% were born in their current locality, 3.0% were born elsewhere in Palestine, and 3.6% were born outside Palestine. Of Jews (excluding the large fraction who were not Ottoman citizens), 59.0% were born in their current locality, 1.9% were born elsewhere in Palestine, and 39.0% were born outside Palestine.

According to the census 98% of Palestinian Muslims were born in Palestine, compared to 80% of Christians and 42% of Jews. According to Roberto Bachi , head of the Israeli Institute of  Statistics from 1949 onwards, between 1922 and 1945 there was a net Arab migration into Palestine of between 40,000 and 42,000, excluding 9,700 people who were incorporated after territorial adjustments were made to the borders in the 1920s. Based on these figures, and including those netted by the border alterations, Joseph Melzer  calculates an upper boundary of 8.5% for Arab growth in the two decades, and interprets it to mean the local Palestinian community's growth was generated primarily by natural increase in birth rates , for both Muslims and Christians.

Arab immigration was primarily from Lebanon , Syria , Transjordan, and Egypt (all countries that bordered Palestine). [ 115 ] The overall assessment of several British reports was that the increase in the Arab population was primarily due to natural increase. [ 116 ] [ 117 ] These included the Hope Simpson Enquiry (1930), [ 118 ] the Passfield White Paper (1930), [ 119 ] the Peel Commission report (1937), [ 120 ] and the Survey of Palestine (1945). [ 121 ] However, the Hope Simpson Enquiry did note that there was significant illegal immigration from the surrounding Arab territories, [ 118 ] while the Peel Commission and Survey of Palestine claimed that immigration played only a minor role in the growth of the Arab population. The 1931 census of Palestine considered the question of illegal immigration since the previous census in 1922. [ 122 ] It estimated that unrecorded immigration during that period may have amounted to 9,000 Jews and 4,000 Arabs. [ 122 ] It also gave the proportion of persons living in Palestine in 1931 who were born outside Palestine: Muslims, 2%; Christians, 20%; Jews, 58%. [ 122 ] The statistical information for Arab immigration (and expulsions when the clandestine migrants were caught), with a contrast to the figures for Jewish immigration over the same period of 1936–1939, is given by Henry Laurens in the following terms [ 123 ] Palestinian immigration, 1936–1939 Jews Arabs 69,716 2,267 Expulsions of illegals, 1937–1938 Jews Arabs (et al.). 125 1,704 According to Mark Tessler, at least some of the Arab population growth was the result of immigration, mostly from the Sinai, Lebanon, Syria, and Transjordan, stimulated by the relatively favorable economic conditions in Palestine, but he noted differing opinions among scholars over how substantial it was. He cited one study as putting the Arab population growth attributable to immigration between 1922 and 1931 at 7%, meaning that 4% of the Arab population in 1931 was foreign-born, while noting another estimate [ 124 ] put the growth in the Arab population attributable to immigration at 38.7%, which would mean that 11.8% of the Arab population in 1931 was foreign-born. Tessler wrote that \"Israeli as well as Palestinian scholars have disputed this assertion, however, concluding that it is at best a theory and in all probability a myth.\" [ 125 ] In a 1974 study, demographer Roberto Bachi estimated that about 900 Muslims per year were detected as illegal immigrants but not deported. [ 126 ] He noted the impossibility of estimating illegal immigration that was undetected, or the fraction of those persons who eventually departed. [ 126 ] He did note that there was an unexplained increase in the Muslim population between 1922 and 1931, and he did suggest, though qualifying it as a \"mere guess\", that this was due to a combination of unrecorded immigration (using the 1931 census report estimate) and undercounting in the 1922 census. [ 126 ] While noting the uncertainty of earlier data, Bachi also observed that the Muslim population growth in the 19th century appeared to be high by world standards: \"[B]etween 1800 and 1914, the Muslim population had a yearly average increase of an order of magnitude of roughly 6–7 per thousand. This can be compared to the very crude estimate of about 4 per thousand for the \"less developed countries\" of the world (in Asia, Africa, and Latin America) between 1800 and 1910. It is possible that some part of the growth of the Muslim population was due to immigration. However, it seems likely that the dominant determinant of this modest growth was the beginning of some natural increase.\" [ 127 ] According to Justin McCarthy , \"evidence for Muslim immigration into Palestine is minimal. Because no Ottoman records of that immigration have yet been discovered, one is thrown back on demographic analysis to evaluate Muslim migration.\" [ 128 ] McCarthy argues that there was no significant Arab immigration into mandatory Palestine: From analyses of rates of increase of the Muslim population of the three Palestinian sanjaks, one can say with certainty that Muslim immigration after the 1870s was small. Had there been a large group of Muslim immigrants their numbers would have caused an unusual increase in the population and this would have appeared in the calculated rate of increase from one registration list to another ... Such an increase would have been easily noticed; it was not there. [ 129 ] The argument that Arab immigration somehow made up a large part of the Palestinian Arab population is thus statistically untenable. The vast majority of the Palestinian Arabs resident in 1947 were the sons and daughters of Arabs who were living in Palestine before modern Jewish immigration began. There is no reason to believe that they were not the sons and daughters of Arabs who had been in Palestine for many centuries. [ 130 ] McCarthy also concludes that there was no significant internal migration to Jewish areas attributable to better economic conditions: Some areas of Palestine did experience greater population growth than others, but the explanation for this is simple. Radical economic change was occurring all over the Mediterranean Basin at the time. Improved transportation, greater mercantile activity, and greater industry had increased the chances for employment in cities, especially coastal cities... Differential population increase was occurring all over the Eastern Mediterranean, not just in Palestine... The increase in Muslim population had little or nothing to do with Jewish immigration. In fact the province that experienced the greatest Jewish population growth (by .035 annually), Jerusalem Sanjak, was the province with the lowest rate of growth of Muslim population (.009). [ 131 ] Fred M. Gottheil has questioned McCarthy's estimates of immigration. Gottheil says that McCarthy didn't give proper weight to the importance of economic incentives at the time, and that McCarthy cites Roberto Bachi's estimates as conclusive numbers, rather than lower bounds based on detected illegal immigration. [ 124 ] [ 132 ] Gad Gilbar has also concluded that the prosperity of Palestine in the 45–50 years before World War I was a result of the modernization and growth of the economy owing to its integration with the world economy and especially with the economies of Europe. Although the reasons for growth were exogenous to Palestine the bearers were not waves of Jewish immigration, foreign intervention nor Ottoman reforms but \"primarily local Arab Muslims and Christians.\" [ 133 ] However, Gilbar did attribute the rapid growth of Jaffa and Haifa in the final three decades of Ottoman rule in part to migration, writing that \"both attracted population from the rural and urban surroundings and immigrants from outside Palestine.\" [ 134 ] Yehoshua Porath believes that the notion of \"large-scale immigration of Arabs from the neighboring countries\" is a myth \"proposed by Zionist writers\". He writes: As all the research by historian Fares Abdul Rahim and geographers of modern Palestine shows, the Arab population began to grow again in the middle of the nineteenth century. That growth resulted from a new factor: the demographic revolution. Until the 1850s there was no \"natural\" increase of the population, but this began to change when modern medical treatment was introduced and modern hospitals were established, both by the Ottoman authorities and by the foreign Christian missionaries. The number of births remained steady but infant mortality decreased. This was the main reason for Arab population growth. ... No one would doubt that some migrant workers came to Palestine from Syria and Trans-Jordan and remained there. But one has to add to this that there were migrations in the opposite direction as well. For example, a tradition developed in Hebron to go to study and work in Cairo, with the result that a permanent community of Hebronites had been living in Cairo since the fifteenth century. Trans-Jordan exported unskilled casual labor to Palestine; but before 1948 its civil service attracted a good many educated Palestinian Arabs who did not find work in Palestine itself. Demographically speaking, however, neither movement of population was significant in comparison to the decisive factor of natural increase. [ 135 ] Modern era See also: Demographics of Israel , Israelis , Demographics of the Palestinian territories , and Palestinian people § Demographics As of 2014 [update] , Israeli and Palestinian statistics for the overall numbers of Jews and Arabs in the area west of the Jordan, inclusive of Israel and the Palestinian territories , are similar and suggest a rough parity in the two populations. Palestinian statistics estimate 6.1 million Palestinians for that area, while Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics estimates 6.2 million Jews living in sovereign Israel. Gaza is estimated by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to have 1.7 million, and the West Bank 2.8 million Palestinians, while Israel proper has 1.7 million Arab citizens. [ 136 ] According to Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, as of May 2006, of Israel's 7 million people, 77% were Jews , 18.5% Arabs , and 4.3% \"others\". [ 137 ] Among Jews, 68% were Sabras (Israeli-born), mostly second- or third-generation Israelis, and the rest are olim – 22% from Europe and the Americas, and 10% from Asia and Africa, including the Arab countries . [ 138 ] According to these Israeli and Palestinian estimates, the population in Israel and the Palestinian territories stands at from 6.1 to 6.2 million Palestinians  and 6.1 million Jews. [ 136 ] [ failed verification ] According to Sergio DellaPergola , if foreign workers and non-Jewish Russian immigrants in Israel are subtracted, Jews are already a minority in the land between the river and the sea. [ 136 ] DellaPergola calculates that Palestinians as of January 2014 number 5.7 million as opposed to a \"core Jewish population\" of 6.1 million. [ 136 ] The Palestinian statistics are contested by some right-wing Israeli think-tanks and non-demographers such as Yoram Ettinger, who claim they overestimate Palestinian numbers by double-counting and counting Palestinians who live abroad. The double-counting  argument is dismissed by both Arnon Soffer , Ian Lustick [ 139 ] and DellaPergola, the latter dismissing Ettinger's calculations as 'delusional' or manipulated for ignoring the birth-rate differentials between the two populations (3 children per Jewish mother vs 3.4 for Palestinians generally, and 4.1 in the Gaza Strip). DellaPergola allows, however, for an inflation in the Palestinian statistics due to the counting of Palestinians who are abroad, a discrepancy of some 380,000 individuals. [ 136 ] Demographics of the State of Israel Main article: Demographics of Israel Ethnic makeup of the State of Israel (2019) [ 140 ] Ethnic group percent Jews and others 79% Arabs 21% The latest Israeli census was conducted by Israel Central Bureau of Statistics in 2019. Israeli census excludes the Gaza Strip . It also excludes all West Bank Palestinian localities, including those in Area C, while it includes the annexed East Jerusalem . It also includes all Israeli settlements in the West Bank . The census also includes the occupied Syrian territory of Golan Heights . As per this census, the total population in 2019 was 9,140,473. [ 140 ] Israeli population consists of 7,221,442 \" Jews and others \", and 1,919,031 Arabs , almost all of which Palestinians, with 26,261 in Golan Subdistrict , being Syrian, mostly Druze , and a small number Alawite . The population includes the Druze community of Israel (i.e. not Syrian Druze) as well, who generally self-identify as Israeli, and are the only Arab-speaking community that has mandatory military service in the IDF . Demographics of the State of Palestine Main article: Demographics of the State of Palestine The latest Palestinian Census was conducted by Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics in 2017. [ 141 ] The Palestinian census covers the Gaza Strip and the West Bank , including East Jerusalem . The Palestinian census does not cover Israeli settlements in the West Bank including those in East Jerusalem. The census does not provide any ethnic or religious distinction. However, it is reasonable to assume that almost everyone counted is Palestinian Arab . As per this census, the total population of the Palestinian territories was 4,780,978.

The nomadic tribes that were scattered on the outer fringes of the country were converted quite easily, but on the other hand, in my opinion, in the rural sectors, where a population resided that assimilated sociological, technological and religious innovations at a far slower pace, the dominant religion spread far more gradually. Moreover, vast areas of rural Palestine, such as Galilee and Samaria, had an absolute Jewish or Samaritan majority. The influence of Christianity in these regions was therefore limited and came at a much later stage than in the pagan settlement areas. ^ Steven T.Katz (2008)Introduction.

All this, coupled with immigration and conversion, allegedly meant that the Christianisation of Palestine took place much more rapidly than that of other areas of the Roman Empire, brought in its wake the annihilation of the pagan cults and meant that by the middle of the fifth century there was a clear Christian majority. ^ Jump up to: a b Bar, Doron (2004). \"Population, settlement and economy in Late Roman and Byzantine Palestine (70–641 AD)\" .

The phenomenon was most prominent in Judea, and can be explained by the demographic changes that this region underwent after the second Jewish revolt of 132–135 C.E. The expulsion of Jews from the area of Jerusalem following the suppression of the revolt, in combination with the penetration of pagan populations into the same region, created the conditions for the diffusion of Christians into that area during the fifth and sixth centuries. [...] This regional population, originally pagan and during the Byzantine period gradually adopting Christianity, was one of the main reasons that the monks chose to settle there. They erected their monasteries near local villages that during this period reached their climax in size and wealth, thus providing fertile ground for the planting of new ideas. ^ Schick, Robert (2021).

They came from Circassia and Chechnya, and were refugees from territories annexed by Russia in 1864, and the Bosnian Muslims, whose province was lost to Serbia in 1878. Belonging to this category were the Algerians (Mughrabis), who arrived in Syria and Palestine in several waves after 1850 in the wake of France's conquest of their country and the waves of Egyptian migration to Palestine and Syria during the rule of Muhammad Ali and his son, Ibrahim Pasha. [...] In most cases the Egyptian army dropouts and the other Egyptian settlers preferred to settle in existing localities, rather than to establish new villages. In the southern coastal plain and Ramla zones there were at least nineteen villages which had families of Egyptian origin, and in the northern part of Samaria, including the 'Ara Valley, there are a number of villages with substantial population of Egyptian stock. ^ Grossman, David (2017).

Note 28: The exact percentage of Jews in Palestine prior to the rise of Zionism is unknown. However, it probably ranged from 2 to 5 per cent.

Jewish influx into Palestine. Between 1880 and 1907, the number of Jews in Palestine grew from 23,000 to 80,000. Most of the community resided in Jerusalem, which already had a Jewish majority at the beginning of the influx. [Footnote: Mordecai Elia, Ahavar Tziyon ve-Kolel Hod (Tel Aviv, 1971), appendix A. Between 1840 and 1880 the Jewish settlement in Palestine grew in numbers from 9,000 to 23,000.] The First Aliyah accounted for only a few thousand of the new-comers, and the number of the Biluim among them was no more than a few dozen. Jewish immigration to Palestine had begun to swell in the 1840s, following the liberalization of Ottoman domestic policy (the Tanzimat Reforms) and as a result of the protection extended to immigrants by the European consulates set up at the time in Jerusalem and Jaffa. The majority of immigrants came from Eastern and Central Europe – the Russian Empire, Romania, and Hungary – and were not inspired by modern Zionist ideology. Many were motivated by a blend of traditional ideology (e.g., belief in the sanctity of the land of Israel and in the redemption of the Jewish people through the return to Zion) and practical considerations (e.g., desire to escape the worsening conditions in their lands of origin and to improve their lot in Palestine). The proto-Zionist ideas which had already crystallized in Western Europe during the late 1850s and early 1860s were gaining currency in Eastern Europe. ^ Scholch, Alexander (November 1985). \"The Demographic Development of Palestine, 1850–1882\".
